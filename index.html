    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>After many attempts at finding a lifestyle that suits the unique individual that I am, 
    I have decided to attempt a career in Web Development. I have discovered that I have a natural 
    inclination for programming, and I would love any opportunity to learn as much as I can about 
    computers in general. Other interests of mine include reading about psychology, biographies,
    and all forms of science. I also believe in a healthy body promoting a healthy mind, which is why
    I attempt to be active by running or lifting weights at least four days a week. I have had a full-time
    job since June of 2017 at a warehouse called Amerisource Bergen, taking a year off to take some classes 
    at my local college. I have lived in Indianapolis all of my life and I would prefer to relocate for a job
    because I have the urge to move out of the midwest, maybe even the country.</p>
